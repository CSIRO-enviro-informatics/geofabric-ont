boundaries that have a hydrological relationship to surface water features. These catchment
boundaries in their current form may not completely satisfy legislative or business
requirements, but are intended to provide the building blocks for reporting regions such as
those given in Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions. The AHGFNode and AHGFLink feature
classes provide a simplified, dendritic node link network for input into hydrological models. 

All contracted catchment features of type ContractedArea are aggregations of the
AHGFCatchment units that participate in a relationship of common geographic extent based
upon the location of a contracted node from both Geofabric Surface Cartography and
Geofabric Surface Network or a data sink as defined within the DEM-1S. Levels of confidence
for contracted nodes are further described in the following section of the Geofabric Product
Guide.

Each ContractedArea is assigned with the contracted node identifier (ConNodeID) and the
confidence level (ConLevel) of the contracted node to which they drain. The ContractedArea
features are the drainage areas of a combination of Levels 1 and 2 contracted nodes. These
drainage areas also incorporate catchment areas where there is no discernable flow (at
1:250,000 scale) in the form of stream flow segment features. The allocation of no flow areas
to contracted catchments is performed based on the most likely destination of water falling in
these areas in flood type conditions. """ ;

In previous versions of the Geofabric, the set of contracted catchment features provided a
collection of drainage areas for a set of persistent contracted nodes. In V2.1 these areas have
been further processed to aggregate these features into a contracted catchment hierarchy.
This hierarchy of contracted catchments includes only those catchments for key contracted
nodes taken from a full set of contractible river confluences, sinks, monitoring points and the
inflow and outflow points of water storages. These key contracted nodes form a stable,
logical, dendritic hierarchy of catchments that can be reliably reproduced when moving to
higher resolution or larger scaled data. The contracted catchment hierarchy provides a
reliable and stable set of catchments that, among other things, can be mapped to a number
of types of water reporting areas (depending on the use case) as exemplified by the stable
reporting regions given in Hydrology Reporting Regions.""" .
