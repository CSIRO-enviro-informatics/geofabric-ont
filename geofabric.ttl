    skos:definition """The AHGFContractedCatchment feature class is designed to represent geographic surface boundaries that have a hydrological relationship to surface water features. These catchment boundaries in their current form may not completely satisfy legislative or business requirements, but are intended to provide the building blocks for reporting regions such as those given in Geofabric Hydrology Reporting Regions. The AHGFNode and AHGFLink feature classes provide a simplified, dendritic node link network for input into hydrological models. 

All contracted catchment features of type ContractedArea are aggregations of the AHGFCatchment units that participate in a relationship of common geographic extent based upon the location of a contracted node from both Geofabric Surface Cartography and Geofabric Surface Network or a data sink as defined within the DEM-1S. Levels of confidence for contracted nodes are further described in the following section of the Geofabric Product Guide.

Each ContractedArea is assigned with the contracted node identifier (ConNodeID) and the confidence level (ConLevel) of the contracted node to which they drain. The ContractedArea features are the drainage areas of a combination of Levels 1 and 2 contracted nodes. These drainage areas also incorporate catchment areas where there is no discernable flow (at 1:250,000 scale) in the form of stream flow segment features. The allocation of no flow areas to contracted catchments is performed based on the most likely destination of water falling in these areas in flood type conditions. 

Contracted Catchments are always within River Regions.""" ;
    skos:historyNote """Contracted catchment hierarchy

In previous versions of the Geofabric, the set of contracted catchment features provided a collection of drainage areas for a set of persistent contracted nodes. In V2.1 these areas have been further processed to aggregate these features into a contracted catchment hierarchy. This hierarchy of contracted catchments includes only those catchments for key contracted nodes taken from a full set of contractible river confluences, sinks, monitoring points and the inflow and outflow points of water storages. These key contracted nodes form a stable, logical, dendritic hierarchy of catchments that can be reliably reproduced when moving to higher resolution or larger scaled data. The contracted catchment hierarchy provides a reliable and stable set of catchments that, among other things, can be mapped to a number of types of water reporting areas (depending on the use case) as exemplified by the stable reporting regions given in Hydrology Reporting Regions.""" ;
